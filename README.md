# CachyOS Install
This is meant to collect my notes as I try to move on from Windows on my gaming PC.

## Fresh Install

My PC has two M.2 SSD's, one with windows 11 and one with CachyOS. For the install I used the following options:

### 1. Boot Manager
I went with **rEFInd** because I don't need BIOS support and wanted something customizable.

### 2. Filesystem
I went with the default BTRFS because it includes snapshot functionality. 

### 3. Desktop Environment
**KDE Plasma** Straight forward and supports Wayland.
